# Exporting Mods
 When viewing the Queue Window, there are two options at the bottom. 
#### 

 "__***Pack Queued***__" will pack the queued files into their respective .**rbin** files, where you will then be prompted to save each one as they finish. Note that only the .**rbin** files showed in the queue will be exported, as it would be pointless to do the rest.
#### 

 "__***Export Mod***__" will pack the queued files, aside from .**rbin** files, into a mod archive, where users can install them into the built in Mod Manager, **Exam Editor**. You may specifiy the mod's name, author, description, link, and preview image. After finishing, you will be prompted to save the archive. Regardless of where you save it, the files will also be added to your Exam Editor's mods.
