# Adding Files
 Adding files is very simple. Simply click the (+) button. You can either add an .rbin file, or any other file.
#### 
## If you add an .rbin file,
 The .rbin file will be added to the column at the left after extracting. Clicking on it will let you browse the contents.
#### 
## If you add any other file,
 The file will be added to "**User-Added.rbin**" after any unpacking it may need to go through. You can then browse its contents after clicking on "**User-Added.rbin**".
