# Packing Files
 Packing files is what allows them to work in the first place. There's two ways of packing with this program. A regular pack, and a queue pack.
#### 
## __Pack__
 You can pack .pmo, .l2d, and .ctt files by selecting "**Pack**" when right-clicking one. Attempting to do so will fail on other files, for your information. If you plan on packing .pmo or .l2d files, please pack any .ctt files edited inside them first.
#### 
 When packing .ctt files, a Romhacking Suite window may appear, in which case, please refer to the "**Romhacking Suite**" section.
#### 
## __Queue Pack__
 The Queue Pack feature is primarily made for packing .rbin files. Any files that are in the Queue will be packed into their respective .rbin files. ***If you want your file to be packed into the .rbin file, it must be queued.***
 
 Upon Right-Clicking a file, choosing the "**Queue/Unqueue Pack**" option will do as said, it will queue files to be packed, or if used on an already queued file, it will unqueue it.
#### 
 When adding a file to the queue, any files that it is inside of will also be added. The queue can be viewed at any time by clicking the "**View Queue**" button. You can return to the normal view by pressing the "**View Files**" button, which will appear in the same location.

 Once all files needed are queued, Right-Click any file and click "**Pack Queued**", or click the "**Pack Queued**" button while viewing the queue. Files inside the queue that can be packed inof themselves, being .pmo, .l2d, and .ctt files, will be packed as well.
