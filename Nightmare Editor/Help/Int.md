# Welcome to Nightmare Editor!
 **It's highly recommended that you leave this window** ***open*** **as you work. There are many confusing things about this program, after all.**

 Although this is called a "help window", it may be better to think of it as built-in documentation. It outlines how things work and what to do.

 It's also best that you read this help window at least once through before starting. It's like reading a console modding guide before hacking it, even if you have the process memorized, it's best to know what you're getting into first.
