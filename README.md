# Nightmare Editor

## About
 This project was solo developed by me, Solt11, out of hatred for the modding process and the wish to make it more convenient. It is a program that acts as a helper for a different set of tools made by the Deep Dive Translations team. My hope is that this program helps someone in their modding endevours.

 I have no idea who these people are, but there tools are what make this whole thing possible. They are much appreciated for that, and I thank them dearly.
### OpenKH
 The #ddd-modding channel has bore the pains with me as I developed this. They also showed to me that modding this game actually *is* possible.
